# AAC Starter (PWA) — Repo Skeleton

This starter repo is a minimal Progressive Web App (PWA) skeleton for an open-source, free AAC application.

Features included:
- React + TypeScript (Vite)
- TailwindCSS
- Dexie (IndexedDB) DB wrapper skeleton
- Simple Board renderer and sample board JSON
- Web Speech API TTS wrapper
- PWA manifest and simple service-worker
- MIT license

How to run locally (requires Node 18+):
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:5173

You can use this as a foundation for the AAC project. It intentionally keeps symbol assets out for now (you said symbols undecided). The board JSON format is simple and exportable.
